My tools for using the [micro editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/) in CS 315

1. arm_asm.yaml is a syntax file for ARM assembly language. 
Copy it to `~/.config/micro/syntax/arm_asm.yaml`
1. arm_asm.lua is a plugin which tells micro to use arm_asm.yaml for files with the .s 
extension. Copy it to `~/.config/micro/plug/arm_asm/arm_asm.lua`
1. xcodelike.micro is a micro colorscheme for those who like light colors. 
Copy it to `~/.config/micro/colorschemes/xcodelike.micro`
